# How much water does it take to make electricity?

Water, as we know, is a really important resource. Given that we are already straining our water resources, some states already are planning for their water shortages. It would be good to understand the impact of power generation on water. As electricity can be generated in different ways, let's explore the best ways to generate electricity with respect to water usage. 

Department of Energy published the following water consumption and withdrawl [data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/operational-water-consumption-and-withdrawal-factors-for-electricity-generating-technologi) for different electricity generators. Looking into the dataset we understand that there is a difference between consumption and withdrawl of water. In essence, if the power plant uses water from a river for a process and pumps that water back, it is called withdrawl. But if the water is converted into steam, and not returned to the water source it's called consumption.
